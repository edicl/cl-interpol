Complete documentation for CL-INTERPOL can be found in the 'doc'
directory.

CL-INTERPOL also supports Nikodemus Siivola's HYPERDOC, see
<http://common-lisp.net/project/hyperdoc/> and
<http://www.cliki.net/hyperdoc>.

1. Installation

1.1. Probably the easiest way is

       (load "/path/to/cl-interpol/load.lisp")

     This should compile and load CL-INTERPOL on most Common Lisp
     implementations.

1.2. With MK:DEFSYSTEM you can make a symbolic link from
     'cl-interpol.system' and 'cl-interpol-test.system' to your central registry
     (which by default is in '/usr/local/lisp/Registry/') and then issue
     the command

       (mk:compile-system "cl-interpol")

     Note that this relies on TRUENAME returning the original file a
     symbolic link is pointing to. This will only work with AllegroCL
     6.2 if you've applied all patches with (SYS:UPDATE-ALLEGRO).

1.3. You can also use ASDF instead of MK:DEFSYSTEM in a similar way
     (use the .asd files instead of the .system files).

In order to actually use CL-INTERPOL you have to enable its reader
syntax with CL-INTERPOL:ENABLE-INTERPOL-SYNTAX - see the docs.

2. Test

For a quick test load the file "test.lisp" after installing
CL-INTERPOL. (Note: SBCL will emit tons of compiler notes when loading
"test.lisp" but it will eventually, after a couple of minutes, pass
all tests - at least it does for me with 0.8.4.8.)
